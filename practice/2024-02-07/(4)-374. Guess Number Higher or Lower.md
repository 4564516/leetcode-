### 題目描述

```
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.
```

### 答案
```
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 int guess(int num);

class Solution {
    public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        long long lo = 0;
        long long hi = n;
        while(lo <= hi){
            long long mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if(guess(mid) == 1){
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == -1){
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == 0){
                return mid;
            }   
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
